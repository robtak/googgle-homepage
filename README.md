This is an HTML/CSS project that to test my knowledge on what I have learned since I started learning on THE ODIN PROJECT to the point I have gotten to in the project.

I tested my knowledge on the following in both HTML and CSS

==> HTML structure; I have learned and understanf the basic structure of an html web page and the element that  enable you to build the it.
Elements like;
==>  <!DOCTYPE html> which specify the version of HMTL.
==> <html> which is the main HTML tag in which all other HTML tags reside.
==> <head> which contains the page information.
==> <title> which is the title for the web page.
==> <body> which is the container for main content on your web page.
==> <a href=""></a> for links to other web pages.
==> <img src="" /> for adding images to a web page.
==> <ul>,<ol>,<li> for creating a list of items on a web page.
==> <div> for breaking a web page to various sections.
==> e.t.c

==> CSS structure or syntax; I have learned the basic CSS syntax used for styling web pages to a desirable preference of the developer. Like moving content on the web page to different locations, changing the color,font-size,font-family,text-docoration,background-color,margin, padding, border,display, and e.t.c.
